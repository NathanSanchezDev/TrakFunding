## Introduction

Welcome to the Finance Management App, a demonstration of a personal finance tool designed to showcase its key features and technology stack. Please note that this is a mock application created solely for illustrative purposes for a fictitious company. This mock app does not represent a real product or company.

## Key Features

### 1. Streamline Your Expenses

Managing your finances can be complex, which is why this app offers a simplified expense tracker. With just a few clicks, you can effortlessly monitor your income, expenses, and net worth.

## Technology Stack

This app is built using a modern technology stack:

- **Frontend Framework:** The app is developed with React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. React offers a responsive and dynamic user experience.

- **Backend Technology:** In a real application, a backend powered by Node.js would handle data processing and storage. However, for demonstration purposes, the backend has been removed.

- **Data Visualization:** The app utilizes libraries like Chart.js for charting and data visualization, enabling users to interact with their financial data visually.

- **Responsive Design:** The app is designed to be responsive, ensuring a seamless experience on various devices, including desktops, tablets, and mobile phones.

- **Database (Demo):** Please note that the database, typically hosted with MongoDB, has been removed for demo purposes. In a production environment, MongoDB or a similar database would store and manage financial data securely.
